(Intro)
(Beat starts with a funky bassline and rhythmic finger snaps)
Word up, check the mic, one two... Helwan's in the house!

(Verse - The Power of Code)
Yo, for the developers, this code is elite,
Got that power level that can't be beat.
For the creatives out there, paintin' the scene,
This the illest platform that you've ever seen.

(Pre-Chorus - The Connection)
And for beginners learnin', it's straight from the heart,
The easiest way for you to make your mark.
(High-energy synth build up)

(Chorus - The Anthem)
HELWAN LINUX, THE FUTURE'S ILL!
HELWAN LINUX, IT'S GOT THE SKILL! (Yeah!)
HELWAN LINUX, KEEPIN' IT REAL!
HELWAN LINUX! PEACE!
