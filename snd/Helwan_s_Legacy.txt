(Intro)
Word up, check the mic, one two... Helwan's in the house.

(Verse - The Build Up)
Yo, for the developers, this code is elite,
Got that power level that can't be beat.
For the creatives out there, paintin' the scene,
This the illest platform that you've ever seen.
And for beginners learnin', it's straight from the heart,
The easiest way for you to make your mark.

(Chorus - The Anthem)
HELWAN LINUX, THE FUTURE'S ILL!
HELWAN LINUX, IT'S GOT THE SKILL! (Yeah!)
HELWAN LINUX, KEEPIN' IT REAL!
HELWAN LINUX! PEACE!
