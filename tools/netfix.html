    <h2>How to Use NetFix</h2>
    <p>Using NetFix is as simple as clicking a button:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the tool by typing <code>netfix</code> in your terminal or selecting it from the menu.</li>
        <li>When the window appears, click the button for the task you need.</li>
        <li>A window will pop up asking for your password (this is safe; it needs permission to fix system files).</li>
        <li>Watch the <strong>Live Output</strong> area to see exactly what the tool is doing.</li>
        <li>Wait for the <strong>Progress Bar</strong> to finish before closing the app.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Quick Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't Interrupt:</strong> Avoid closing the window while a repair is in progress to prevent errors.</li>
        <li><strong>One at a Time:</strong> The interface will temporarily lock while a task is running to keep your system safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Reading:</strong> If a task fails, errors will be clearly marked in red (ERROR:) in the text area.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section note">
    <strong>User Safety:</strong> NetFix is built for Arch-based systems and is safe to use. However, as with any system repair, it's always good practice to keep backups of your important files.
