<h1>🔍 Momo: The Helwan System Doctor</h1>

<main>
    <section>
        <h2>What is Momo?</h2>
        <p>Think of **Momo** as a digital doctor for your computer. Instead of typing complex commands to find out why your PC is slow or if your hardware is healthy, Momo gives you a simple menu to check everything in one place.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How to start?</h2>
        <p>You don't need to look for files or folders. Just open your <strong>Terminal</strong> and type one simple word:</p>
        <pre><code>momo</code></pre>
        <p>That's it! The "Doctor" is now ready to assist you .</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What can Momo do for you?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Check Health:</strong> See if your hard drive or SSD is healthy or needs replacement.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Speed:</strong> Measure how fast your internet and memory (RAM) really are .</li>
            <li><strong>Stress Test:</strong> Make sure your computer won't crash when you do heavy work or gaming.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature Monitor:</strong> Check if your device is getting too hot.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Easy Controls</h2>
        <p>Momo is designed to be used with just your keyboard:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arrow Keys (↑/↓):</strong> Move between different tests.</li>
            <li><strong>Enter:</strong> Start the selected test.</li>
            <li><strong>"A" Key:</strong> The "Auto-Check" mode—Momo will test everything for you automatically!</li>
            <li><strong>"Q" Key:</strong> Safely close the doctor's office and go back to work.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you want to check your disks (SSD/HDD), run the command as <code>sudo momo</code>. This gives the doctor "X-ray" vision to see deep into your hardware.
    </div>

    <section>
        <h2>Peace of Mind</h2>
        <p>Everything Momo finds is saved in a report file in your home folder (<code>~/.momo/logs</code>). If you ever need help from the Helwan community, you can just send them these logs.</p>
