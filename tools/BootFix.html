    <h2>What can this tool do for you?</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Boot Fix (The "Wake Up" Button)</h3>
    <p><strong>Use this when:</strong> Your computer starts but doesn't reach the login screen, or you see a black screen with text errors like "GRUB".</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It rebuilds the bridge between your hardware and the system.</li>
        <li>It makes Helwan Linux visible again in the startup menu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Recovery Mode (The "Deep Clean" Button)</h3>
    <p><strong>Use this when:</strong> Your system is running, but it feels "broken" or "stuck". For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You cannot install new apps because of "locked database" errors.</li>
        <li>Your apps refuse to open or crash for no reason.</li>
        <li>Your computer is very slow because the disk is full of temporary junk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>It unlocks your system, repairs broken links, and clears out digital waste.</em></p>

    <h3>3. Chroot Helper (The "Emergency Entrance")</h3>
    <p><strong>Use this when:</strong> You are using a Live USB and need to "enter" your main hard drive to fix it from the outside.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Helpful for resetting a forgotten password.</li>
        <li>Used for advanced repairs if the system is completely unresponsive.</li>
    </ul>
